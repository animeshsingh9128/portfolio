    <br> </br>
<p> I am Animesh kumar Singh, a front-end developer with skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Using these, I make websites that not only look good but also work smooth. I know how to put together web content with HTML, style it up with CSS, and make it interactive with JavaScript. I'm all about creating stuff that users enjoy and find easy to use. Keeping up with new trends and tech in web development is my thing, so I can always bring something fresh to the table.</p>
